Welcome to my journey in building my own homelab. This will hopefully be an ongoing series of blog posts of my adventures in building my own personal infrastructure.

## What is a Homelab

The primary idea behind a homelab is a place to learn about infrastructure, servers and development.

/r/homelab defines a homelab as:

> Homelab \[hom-l√¶b\](n): a laboratory of (usually slightly outdated) awesome in the domicile

Now by this definition a homelab should reside in a home. In my case only part of my homelab will exist at home due to space and noise constraints (servers can be quite loud).

The [/r/homelab wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/wiki/introduction) has a more information on what a homelab is and how to get started.

## Inventory

At the time of writing this is my current inventory of servers. It will most likely grow and evolve as time goes on. You can see most of my homelab exists outside my home.

* 1 VPS
  * CPU: 2 Cores
  * RAM: 2GB
  * Disk: 40GB SSD
* 1 NAS
  * CPU: Intel i5-6600K
  * RAM: 8GB
  * Disk: 2x 250GB SSD, 4x 3TB WD Red
* 2 Dedicated Servers
  * Dedicated Server 1
    * CPU: 2x Intel Xeon L5420
    * RAM: 16GB
    * Disk: 4x 1TB HDD
  * Dedicated Server 2
    * CPU: Intel Xeon E3 1230 v3
    * RAM: 32GB
    * Disk: 2x 2TB HDD

## Goals

* Ability to host applications easily. There is a lot of good self hosted software out there.
* Keep ongoing maintenance to a minimum. I am doing this in my free time not as a full time job.
* Automatic encrypted backups, because RAID is not a backup.
* Ability to easily add and remove servers. This allows me to keep my homelab as small or as large as I need.
* An internal network between servers, some of my servers exist outside of my home network.
* Alerting and Monitoring, so I know when servers go down, SMART says a drive is failing, backups didn't run, etc.

## The Plan

These are the tools/software I decided on to solve each of the above goals.

### Hosting Applications Easily

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for hosting most applications, and allows me to move services around easily.

    I decided against [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) for many reasons:

  * I don't know how it will perform over the internet
  * My servers are very different from each other and would require me to [assign pods to specific nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/)
  * I can always move to kubernetes once I have a more localized homelab

* [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) for managing the docker containers on specific servers.
* [Salt](https://github.com/saltstack/salt) for everything else that doesn't fit into a container.

### Minimizing Ongoing Maintenance

* [Automatic security updates](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticSecurityUpdates)
* [Watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower) will keep selected containers up to date.

### Automatic Backups

* [restic](https://restic.net/) for backups, including deduplication and encryption.
* Amazon S3/Backblaze B2 for offsite storage of backups.

### Adding and Removing Servers

* [Salt](https://github.com/saltstack/salt) allows me to have a declarative configuration for the servers. This means adding a new server to salt ensures it will have all of my configurations setup.
* DNS for servers and services to facilitate container movement. This will be configured automatically or through [dnscontrol](https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol).

### Internal Network

* [Zerotier](https://www.zerotier.com/) is for my internal network. It's not a fully decentralized like [tinc](https://www.tinc-vpn.org/) but has some tradeoffs that make it easier to use, you can read more about it [here](http://adamierymenko.com/decentralization.html)

### Alerting and Monitoring

* [Icinga2](https://icinga.com/docs/icinga2/latest/) will be used for alerting.
* [Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/) is used for gathering metrics on the server.
* [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/influxdb/) is a time series database used for storage of metrics gathered from telegraf.
* [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is used for making graphs and dashboards from the data stored in influxdb.
